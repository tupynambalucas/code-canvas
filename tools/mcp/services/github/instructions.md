## 🚀 Workflow Principles

### Domain Core First

Any change affecting data models or shared schemas must originate in the respective core package (`@elo-instance/core` or `@elo-portal/core`) before being propagated to the associated applications.

### Automated Verification

Before merging, ensure that `npm run lint:all` and `npm run build:all` (in respective packages) pass successfully.
