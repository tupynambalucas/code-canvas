## Technical Guardrails Checklist

Please verify that your code adheres to all project quality standards before requesting review:

- [ ] **Strict English-First (en-US)**: Technical logic, comments, variable names, and changelogs are written in US English.
- [ ] **Zero Emojis**: Absolutely no emojis are used in the code, comments, or documentation files.
- [ ] **Strict Boolean Logic**: Checked that all JSX conditional expressions are written explicitly (e.g. `{isValid === true && <Component />}` instead of `{isValid && <Component />}`).
- [ ] **No Floating Promises**: Handled or explicitly voided all asynchronous calls (e.g., `void asyncFn()`).
- [ ] **Changeset Generated**: Run `pnpm version:changeset` if any packages under `packages/` or workspaces have changed.
- [ ] **Local Verification**: Passed all local verification suites (`pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck`).
